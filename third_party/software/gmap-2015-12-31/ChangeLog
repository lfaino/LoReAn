      instead of querypos5 and querypos3, respectively.

    * stage3hr.c: Allowing both ends to be of type TERM in a terminal, and
      checking for mismatches only between the trimmed ends.  Requiring that

      alignments, since that is a duplication of effort

    * stage1hr.c, stage3hr.c, stage3hr.h, substring.c, substring.h: Restored

      genomiclength, and pos between chroffset and chrhigh

    * VERSION, index.html: Updated version number

      chroffset to all procedures

    * stage3.c: Better handling of ends: pass 8, best_local plus known splicing;
      pass 9, queryend_indels; pass 10, queryend_nogaps.  Medial gap not using
      known splicing.  Simplified trim_ends procedure.  Not removing or
      re-inserting known intron gaps.  Bayesian computation of mapping scores
      for GMAP alignments.

      implementing part of Smith-Waterman on each end.  Added special cases in
      traceback for 5' and 3' ends, but may not be necessary in light of the
      other changes.

    * gmapindex.c, snapindex.c: Allowed the user to specify a directory for the
      BerkeleyDB environment.

2002-05-28  twu

    * Makefile, gmapindex.c, segmentpos.c, snapindex.c: Added specification of
      segmentfile as flag -g.

    * Makefile, database.c, database.h, gmapindex.c, snapindex.c: Removed
      genome_db and delta_db from snapindex.

    * Makefile, gmapindex.c, segmentpos.c, segmentpos.h, snapindex.c: Added
      ability to dump segments (in order) from segmentpos_db

    * Makefile: Changed flags for C compiler.

    * segmentpos.c: Added check to get previous segment only in some cases.

2002-05-22  twu

    * Makefile, gmap.c, oligo.c, oligo.h, read.c, read.h, readcirc.c,
      readcirc.h, scan.c, scan.h, segmentpos.c, segmentpos.h, snap.c: Working
      version of snap using a scan of genomic and delta information.

    * Makefile, cell.c, cell.h, database.c, database.h, gmap.c, gmapindex.c,
      hit.c, hit.h, offset.c, offset.h, offsetdb.c, offsetdb.h, oligo.c,
      oligo.h, scan.c, scan.h, snap.c, snapindex.c, table.c, table.h: Made
      changes to store delta position of genomic oligos and to store oligos of
      query sequence.

2002-05-08  twu

    * Makefile, database.c, database.h, gmap.c, gmapindex.c, hash-oligos.c,
      snap.c, snapindex.c: Consolidated sample-oligos and hash-oligos into
      snapindex.  Specified oligo dbtype by using Berkeley DB constants.

2002-05-03  twu

    * Makefile, cell.c, cell.h, database.c, database.h, hit.c, read.c,
      readcirc.c, sample-oligos.c: Separated database commands for oligos from
      the other database (aux).

2002-04-26  twu

    * Makefile, gmap.c, hit.c, oligo.c, read.c, readcirc.c, snap.c: Removed
      environment.  Began implementation of dynamic programming.

    * Makefile, chrnum.c, chrnum.h, database.c, database.h, gmap.c,
      hash-oligos.c, hit.c, hit.h, offset.c, offset.h, offsetdb.c, offsetdb.h,
      oligo.c, oligo.h, read.c, read.h, readcirc.c, readcirc.h, snap.c:
      Re-implementation of SNAP using new database created by hash-oligos.

2002-04-24  twu

    * segmentpos.c, segmentpos.h: Handled problems with chromosome string to
      integer conversions.

    * hash-oligos.c: Handled problems with chromosome string to integer
      conversions.  Rearranged calls to db->open so that each db is opened only
      once.

    * Makefile, btree.c, btree.h, hash-oligos.c, hash.c, hash.h, oligo.c,
      oligo.h: Consolidated code into fewer files.

    * Makefile: Changed CFLAGS to optimize speed.

    * cell.h: Matched up .h file with .c file.

    * Makefile, genomicpos.c, genomicpos.h, hash-oligos.c, segmentpos.c,
      segmentpos.h: Now storing genomic locations as global positions, which
      require keeping track of chromosomal offsets.

    * Makefile, btree.c, btree.h, cell.c, cell.h, entry.c, entry.h,
      genomicpos.c, genomicpos.h, hash-oligos.c, sample-oligos.c: Major change
      to allow B-trees, to avoid storing adjacent oligos, to store genomic
      positions, and to write oligos in binary format.

2002-04-22  twu

    * Makefile, assert.c, assert.h, block.c, block.h, bool.h,
      buffer-thread-attempt.c, buffer-thread-attempt.h, buffer.c, buffer.h,
